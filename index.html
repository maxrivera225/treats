			<p class="intro"> <p><span>BROOKLYN, NY —</span>Costume-clad CUNY employees took to Borough Hall in Brooklyn on Wednesday to push for raises and improved working conditions for the members of their union, the Professional Staff Congress.<p>

					<p>Union members at the rally accused high-level CUNY administrators of loading up on work perks, like free rent, while ignoring demands for a livable wage increase for faculty and teachers. The rally also served to build momentum for a PSC-led march in Albany on Dec. 2.<p>
					
					<p>The union, CUNY-PSC, AFT Local 2334, has been out of contract since February.  A new deal has not been presented to the union, James Davis, union president said.<p>
					
					<p>The union shared its contract demands in <a href="https://psc-cuny.org/clarion/2023/march/2023-march-a-fair-contract-for-a-peoples-cuny/#:~:text=A.%20Salary" target="_blank">March.</a> They range from above-inflation wage hikes to contract carve outs that increase the option to work remotely.<p> 
					<p><b>“No more tricks. It’s time for treats,” he said.</b><p>
					
					<p>CUNY has yet to respond to a request for comment on the status of contract negotiations.<p>
					
					<p>Lincoln Restler, a Democrat City Council member who attended the rally, called the CUNY system “the most powerful engine for social and economic mobility in the entire country.”<p>
					
					<p>Restler, who said he had family members and staff who are CUNY alums, said the PSC has stood by other unions in their times of need.<p>
					
					<p>Along with its other demands, the union is also looking to improve the student experience. A move Restler describes as selfless and “values-driven.”<p>
					
					<p>Attendees held signs to raise awareness about facility hazards like mold or broken chairs.<p>
					
					<p>“Our working conditions are their learning conditions,” Ben Shepard, a City College professor of human services,said.<p>
					
					<p>The rally featured speakers from across the CUNY system, but skewed toward speakers from Brooklyn area CUNY schools like Medgar Evers College and City TECH. Crowds favored Halloween- themed chants:<p>
					
					<p><b>“No more ghouls! No more fools! Bring funding back to public schools!”</b><p>
					
					<p>Governor Kathy Hochul’s proposed fiscal year 2024 budget includes a modest increase in funding earmarked for CUNY. But PSC members are worried about the threat of Adams administration’s budget cuts.  CUNY has fought the mayor on previous attempts to axe spending. Rally participants said the CUNY system, a home to many first-generation and minority college students, is an easy target.<p>
					
					<p>“Racialized austerity,” Deborah Hertzberg, chief certified laboratory technician, said.<p>
					
					<p>For Carl Schlachte, a writing teacher at Kingsborough Community College, the rally wasn’t just an event to ask for more money or better facilities. He attended to support a school that has given him more than a job. Not only is he a CUNY alum and employee, but met his wife, a CUNY employee, at work. They have a young son, Charlie, who attended the rally with his parents.<p>
					
					<p>“I want my son to go to CUNY,” he said. “CUNY is everything to me.”<p>
